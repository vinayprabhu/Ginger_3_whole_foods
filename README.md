# Ginger_3_whole_foods

On 31st of March, 2018, I ambled in to a Whole <strike>foods</strike> paycheck store in SF and chanced upon a bunch of rhizomes of the Ginger family.
They reminded me of my trip a few months ago to the [Singapore botanical garden](https://github.com/vinayprabhu/Singapore_botanic_gardens) where I had first chanced upon some other
exotic little known variants of the Ginger family.
I duly snapped a bunch of pics wondering if I can use these subtly different classes in a transfer learning context.
